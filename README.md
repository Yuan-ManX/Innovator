# Innovator — A General AI Agent Framework for Animation, Film & Game Creation

Innovator is a general AI agent framework designed for animation production, film-making, and game development workflows.
It enables creators to build intelligent agents capable of understanding creative intent, planning complex tasks, and executing end-to-end content creation pipelines across animation, cinematic storytelling, visual production, and interactive game content.

Innovator integrates large language models with memory, planning systems, tool orchestration, and conditional reasoning, forming a flexible and extensible foundation for next-generation creative AI agents across animation, film, and games.

AI Agent = LLM + Memory + Planning + Tools + Conditions + Creative Intelligence + World Interaction
