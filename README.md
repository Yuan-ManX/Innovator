# Innovator — A General AI Agent Framework for Animation, Film & Game Creation

Innovator is a general AI agent framework designed for animation production, film-making, and game development workflows.
It enables creators to build intelligent agents capable of understanding creative intent, planning complex tasks, and executing end-to-end content creation pipelines across animation, cinematic storytelling, visual production, and interactive game content.

Innovator integrates large language models with memory, planning systems, tool orchestration, and conditional reasoning, forming a flexible and extensible foundation for next-generation creative AI agents across animation, film, and games.

AI Agent = LLM + Memory + Planning + Tools + Conditions + Creative Intelligence + World Interaction

## 🔧 Installation

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 Multi‑Agent Creative Intelligence

Innovator defines a multi‑agent architecture composed of:

- **Planner Agent** — decomposes tasks and generates stage plans  
- **Director Agent** — enforces creative direction, style, and constraints  
- **Animation / Film / Game Agents** — handle domain‑specific execution  
- **Render Agent** — bridges scene data to video/image rendering systems  
- **Confidence‑Based Router** — dispatches tasks dynamically with auto‑fallback

This approach enables structured pipelines similar to real‑world production teams, but fully driven by AI.
